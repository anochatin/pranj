                <p>Hey pranjali</p>
               
                <p>
                    You might be wondering why a random guy sent you a random link it was really difficult for this random guy to send this random link trust me it took many days, Sorry for lying about that letter, Yes it was from me only, I know I'm dumb and it was cringe, its new to me never had feeling like this before I thought i might forget you but its not happening so this random guy gathered courage and sent you this you were right I should have confessed, at least I would have known its a yes or no and I wont have to go through this battle between my feeling and my mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At first when I saw you I didn't even noticed you but one day all of a sudden I don't know how when and why maybe it's something but I started noticing your smile hidden by your hair,and your eyes hidden by your specs, and one day all of a sudden you were looking so majestic I pondered and thought this was just a temporary attraction, In the anticipation that I might lose these new found attractions doubted the depth of my feelings, but. Boy I was wrong After so many sleepless nights and painful Days here I'm confessing,this is new to me I never had feelings like this before and on top of that telling someone it's difficult but I couldn't withstand the tyranny of my own feelings
                </p>
                <p>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whenever I'm out on campus my eyes are just looking for you nothing like this has ever happened to me the whole world in front of me and my eyes would only search for you With each passing day, you occupied my thoughts, stealing the spotlight from the chaos of the world around me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can say no to whatever this is you have free will but please check the whole website cause I have made it for you and only you don't show it to no one else please, you are majestic and I know even this much effort is not enough to get you. It is a feeble attempt to articulate the tumultuous emotions swirling within me, a futile endeavor to convey the depth of my feelings for you. But alas, words failed me, and I resorted to a coding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You said confess your feelings, if only that was easier there are 50% chances that you would say yes but I don't think you consider the other 50% where you might end up hating me,
                </p>
                <p>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started thinking more and more about you and this idiot brain of mine it won't let me forget you so I gathered courage to approach you but the point being I haven't felt this way for anyone and I was clueless about what to do I wanted it to be something epic, I really like old school love movies and romcons so to make it look a little old it's inspired by win95
                </p>
                <p>
                    So After more than 6000 lines of code and 26 sleepless night i present to you this OS inspired by win95 just for you.
